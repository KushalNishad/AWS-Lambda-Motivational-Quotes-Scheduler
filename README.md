# AWS Lambda Motivational Quotes Scheduler

## üìå Overview
This project is an AWS Lambda function that sends a **random motivational quote** daily at **9:00 AM UTC** using **Amazon EventBridge Scheduler** and **Amazon SES**.

## üöÄ Features
- Fetches a random quote from a **CSV file** stored in **S3**.
- Sends an **email notification** using **Amazon SES**.
- Uses **AWS EventBridge Scheduler** to run the function **daily at 9:00 AM**.

## üèó Architecture
- **Amazon S3**: Stores the CSV file containing motivational quotes.
- **AWS Lambda**: Reads the CSV file, selects a random quote, and triggers SES.
- **Amazon SES**: Sends the email with the quote.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Triggers Lambda function daily at 9:00 AM.

## üõ† Setup & Deployment
### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- IAM Role with permissions for Lambda, EventBridge, SES, and S3
- Python installed locally

## [Working with Python Layers using manylinux wheel distribution](docs/WorkingWithPythonLayers.md)
- We need pandas to work with csv file.
- As pandas package is not directly avaiblable in Amazon Linux enviroment, we have to package the pandas layer so that we can use it in our code.
- [Sometimes, a package that you want to include as a dependency won't have a universal wheel (specifically, it doesn't have any as the platform tag). In this case, download the wheel that supports manylinux instead. This ensures that your layer libraries are compatible with Amazon Linux.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-layers.html#python-layer-manylinux)
